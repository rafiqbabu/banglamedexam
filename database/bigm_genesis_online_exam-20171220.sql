It descends through the fibres of the psoas major muscle, and appears at its medial border near the brim of the pelvis. It then passes behind the common iliac vessels and runs along the lateral wall of the lesser pelvis to reach the upper part of the obturator foramen, anterosuperior to the obturator vessels. During this course it is on the lateral side of the hypogastric vessels and ureter, with the hypogastric vessels separating it from the ureter. From the upper part of the obturator foramen it enters the thigh, and divides into anterior and posterior branches, which are separated at first by some of the fibres of the obturator externus muscle, and lower down by adductor brevis. The anterior branch leaves the pelvis anterior to the obturator externus. It descends anterior to the adductor brevis and posterior 4 to the pectineus and adductor longus. It forms a plexus with the anterior cutaneous and saphenous branches of the femoral nerve at the lower border of the adductor longus. It then descends on the femoral artery, to which it is finally distributed. Near the obturator foramen the nerve gives off an articular branch to the hip joint. Behind pectineus it distributes branches to adductor longus and gracilis, usually to adductor brevis and, in rare cases, to the pectineus muscle. When the accessory obturator nerve is present it gives a communicating branch to the obturator nerve.

It passes obliquely across the upper and anterior part of the thigh, from the lateral to the medial side of the limb, then descends vertically, as far as the medial side of the knee, passing behind the medial condyle of the femur to end in a tendon. This curves obliquely forward and expands into a broad aponeurosis, which is inserted in front of the gracilis and semitendinosus, into the upper part of the medial surface of the body of the tibia, nearly as far forward as the anterior crest. The upper part of the aponeurosis is curved backward over the upper edge of the tendon of the gracilis to be inserted behind it. An offset from its upper margin blends with the capsule of the knee joint and another from its lower border with the fascia on the medial side of the leg. It supplied by the second, third and fourth lumbar nerves, through the femoral nerve. The sartorius flexes the leg on the thigh and, continuing to act, flexes the thigh on the pelvis; it next abducts and rotates the thigh outward. When the knee is bent, the sartorius assists the semitendinosus, semimembranosus and popliteus in rotating the tibia inward. Taking its fixed point from the leg, it flexes the pelvis on the thigh and assists in rotating the pelvis. \r\n', NULL, ' Access to surgery ,500 SBA in basic and applied anatomy, Shazad G.

From this tensive origin the fibres converge and form a thick, narrow tendon hich crosses the inferior angle of the scapula (usually receiving a ew fibres from it). The muscle curves around the lower border of the teres major muscle, and is twisted on itself, so that the superior fibres become at first posterior and then inferior, and the vertical fibres become at first anterior and then superior. It is inserted into the bottom of the intertubercular groove of the humerus above the tendon of the pectoralis major through a quadrilateral tendon that is about 7 cm. long. The lower border of its tendon is united with hat of teres major, the surfaces of the two being separated near their insertions by a bursa; another bursa is sometimes interposed between the muscle and the inferior angle of the scapula. The tendon of the muscle gives off an expansion to the deep fascia of the arm. \r\nLatissimus dorsi is supplied by the sixth, seventh and eighth cervical nerves through the thoracodorsal (long subscapular) nerve. When the latissimus dorsi muscle acts on the humerus, it depresses and draws it backward, and at the same time rotates it inward. It is the muscle that is principally employed in giving a downward blow, as in felling a tree. With the arm fixed, the muscle can act in various ways on the trunk; it can raise the lower ribs and assist in forcible inspiration; or, if both arms are fixed, the two muscles can assist the abdominal muscles and pectorals in suspending and drawing the trunk forward, as in climbing. \r\n', NULL, ' Access to surgery ,500 SBA in basic and applied anatomy, Shazad G.

Its contraction leads to opening of the duodenojejunal flexure, which results in the flow of chyme. While commonly referred to as a ligament, it is officially both a suspensory muscle and a suspensory ligament because of its composition and function.

(208, '1', 'Which of the following statements about the rectum is CORRECT?', 'B', '', 'Answer: B It is an important anastomatic site for the portal and caval (systematic) venous systems \r\nThe rectum is continuous above with the sigmoid colon, while below it ends in the anal canal. From its origin at the level of the third sacral vertebra it passes downward, lying in the sacrococcygeal curve, and extends for about 2.5 cm in front of and a little below the tip of the coccyx, as far as the apex of the prostate. It then bends sharply backward into the anal canal. It therefore presents two anteroposterior curves: an upper, with its convexity backward; and a lower, with its convexity forward. Two lateral curves are also described: one to the right, opposite the junction of the third and fourth sacral vertebrae, and the other to the left, opposite the left sacrococcygeal articulation (though these are of little importance). The rectum is about 12 cm long and at its commencement its calibre is similar to that of the sigmoid colon, but near its termination it is dilated to form the rectal ampulla. The rectum has no sacculations comparable to those of the colon, but when the lower part of the rectum is contracted, its mucous membrane is thrown into a number of folds, which are longitudinal in direction and are effaced by the distension of the gut. Besides these, there are certain permanent transverse folds, of a semilunar shape, known as Houston\'s valves. They are usually three in number; sometimes a fourth is found; and occasionally only two are present. One is situated near the commencement of the rectum, on the right side; a second extends inward from the left side of the tube, opposite the middle of the sacrum; a third, the largest and most constant, projects backward from the forepart of the rectum, opposite the fundus of the urinary bladder. When a fourth is present, it is situated nearly 2.5 cm above the anus on the left and posterior wall of the tube. These folds are about 12 mm in width and contain some of the circular fibres of the gut. In the empty state of the intestine, they overlap each other so effectually as to require considerable manoeuvring to insert a bougie or the finger along the canal. These folds support the weight of faecal matter and prevent it from migrating toward the anus, where its presence always stimulates the urge to defecate. \r\n\r\nThe peritoneum is related to the upper two-thirds of the rectum, covering at first its front and sides, but lower down its front only. From the latter it is reflected onto the seminal vesicles in men and the posterior vaginal wall in women. The level at which the peritoneum leaves the anterior wall of the rectum to be reflected onto the viscus in front of it is of considerable importance from a surgical point of view, in connection with the removal of the lower part of the rectum. It is higher in men than in women. In men, the height of the rectovesical excavation is about 7.5 cm, the height to which an ordinary index finger can reach from the anus. In women the height of the rectouterine excavation is about 5.5 cm from the anal orifice. The rectum is surrounded by a dense tube of fascia derived from the fascia endopelvina, but fused behind with the fascia covering the sacrum and coccyx. The fascia\' tube is loosely attached to the rectal wall by areolar tissue to allow for distension of the viscus. \r\n\r\nThe upper part of the rectum Is In relation, behind, to the superior haemorrhoidal vessels, the left piriformis and the left sacral plexus of nerves, which separate it from the pelvic surfaces of the sacral vertebrae. In its lower part it lies directly on the sacrum, coccyx and levatores ani, a dense fascia alone intervening. In front, it is separated above, in the man from the fundus of the bladder, and in the woman from the intestinal surface of the uterus and its appendages, by some convolutions of the small intestine and frequently by the sigmoid colon. Below, it is in relation in the man with the triangular portion of the fundus of the bladder, the vesiculae seminales and ductus deferentes and more anteriorly with the posterior surface of the prostate; in the woman, with the posterior wall of the vagina. The rectum is supplied by the superior rectal (haemorrhoidal) branch of the inferior mesenteric artery. The veins of the rectum commence in a plexus of vessels that surrounds the anal canal. In the vessels forming this plexus are smaller saccular dilatations just within the margin of the anus; from the plexus, about six vessels of considerable size are given off. These ascend between the muscular and mucous coats for about 12.5 cm, running parallel to each other; they then pierce the muscular coat and, by their union, form a single trunk, the superior haemorrhoidal vein. This arrangement is called the haemorrhoidal plexus. It communicates with the tributaries of the middle and inferior haemorrhoidal veins at its commencement and so a communication is established between the systemic and portal circulations. \r\n', NULL, 'Access to surgery ,500 SBA in basic and applied anatomy, Shazad G.

Which of the following organ’s is most likely to be the source of her complaints?', 'B', '', 'Answer: B Liver, duodenum and gallbladder\r\n Referred pain is an unpleasant sensation localised to an area separate from the site of the causative injury or other painful stimulation. Often, referred pain arises when a nerve is compressed or damaged at or near its origin. In this circumstance, the sensation of pain will generally be felt in the territory that the nerve serves, even though the damage originates elsewhere. A common example is spinal disc herniation, in which a nerve roots arising from the spinal cord is compressed by adjacent disc material. Although pain may arise from the damaged disc itself, pain and/or other symptoms will also be felt in the region served by the compressed nerve (for example, the thigh, knee, or foot). Relieving the pressure on the nerve root may ameliorate the referred pain, provided that permanent nerve damage has not occurred. A similar mechanism may be responsible for some instances of the phantom limb syndrome in amputees. \r\nIn another classic example of referred pain, patients who are suffering a myocardial infarction feel pain in their left arm. Other examples of referred pain are the common \'ice cream headache\' or \'brain freeze\' which happens when you accidentally chill the vagus nerve when you eat ice-cold food too quickly, as well as pain from an inflamed gallbladder which may refer pain to the right shoulder and pain from a herniated cervical disc refers pain down one or both arms into the hands. In addition, tooth pain may refer pain that should be localised to the affected tooth to the opposite side of the mouth as opposed to actually feeling pain in the tooth with the cavity or abscess. \r\nIn cases of damage to viscera, referred pain may be due to convergence of visceral nerves that innervate the damaged organs with somatic nerves that innervate sections of skin. Because a neurone from the organ and one from the skin can form a synapse with the same projection neurone in the dorsal horn, input from either neurone will be interpreted the same way by it and all neurones further up the pathway. Because the brain is more \'accustomed\' to receiving sensation from the peripheral structure than from the viscus, it may interpret the pain as originating from the former. So, there is an array of diseases that cause damage to organs and which produce characteristic patterns of pain in unrelated places in the body\'s periphery. \r\n', NULL, ' Access to surgery ,500 SBA in basic and applied anatomy, Shazad G.

The lower, or intertubercular, is a line carried through the highest points of the iliac crests seen from the front, that is through the tubercles on the iliac crests about 5 cm behind the anterior superior spines. An alternative method is that of Addison, who adopts the following lines: An upper transverse, the transpyloric, halfway between the jugular notch and the upper border of the symphysis pubis. This indicates the margin of the transpyloric plane, which in most cases cuts through the pylorus, the tips of the ninth costal cartilages and the lower border of the first lumbar vertebra.

(234, '1', 'The pelvic diaphragm is formed by the:', 'C', '', 'Answer: C Levator ani and coccygeus muscles \r\nLevator ani and coccygeus form the pelvic diaphragm. Levator ani is a broad, thin muscle, situated on the side of the pelvis. It is attached to the inner surface of the side of the lesser pelvis, and unites with its fellow from the opposite side to form the greater part of the floor of the pelvic cavity. It supports the viscera in the pelvic cavity, and surrounds the various structures which pass through it. It takes origin anteriorly from the posterior surface of the superior ramus of the pubis, lateral to the symphysis, and posteriorly from the inner surface of the spine of the ischium. It also arises from the obturator fascia between these two points. Posteriorly, this fascial rigin corresponds, more or less closely, with the tendinous arch of he pelvic fascia, but anteriorly the muscle arises from the fascia at a varying distance above the arch, in some cases reaching nearly as high as the canal for the obturator vessels and nerve. The fibres pass downward and backward to the midline of the floor of the pelvis. The. most posterior are inserted into the side of the last two segments of the coccyx. Those placed more anteriorly unite with the muscle of the opposite side in a median fibrous raphe (the anococcygeal raphe). The anococcygeal raphe extends between the coccyx and the margin of the anus. The middle fibres are inserted into the side of the rectum, blending with the fibres of the sphincter muscles. Finally, the anterior fibres descend on the side of the prostate to unite beneath it with the muscle of the opposite side, joining with the fibres of the external anal sphincter and transversus perinei at the central tendinous point of the perineum. The anterior portion is occasionally separated from the rest of the muscle by connective tissue and is known at the levator prost\'atae because it supports the prostate like a sling. In the female the anterior fibres of the levator ani descend on the side of the vagina. The levator ani is supplied by a branch from the fourth sacral nerve and by a branch that is sometimes derived from the perineal nerve and sometimes from the inferior haemorrhoidal division of the pudendal nerve. \r\nThe coccygeus is situated behind the levator ani. It is a triangular plane of muscular and tendinous fibres It takes origin by its apex from the spine of the ischium and sacrospinous ligament and is inserted by its base into the margin of the coccyx and into the side of the lowest piece of the sacrum. It assists the levator ani and piriformis in closing in the back part of the outlet of the pelvis. The coccygeus is supplied by a branch from the fourth and fifth sacral nerves. The two levatores ani constrict the lower end of the rectum and vagina. They elevate and invert the lower end of the rectum after it has been protruded and everted during the expulsion of the faeces. They are also muscles of forced expiration. The coccygei pull forward and support the coccyx after it has been pressed backward during defecation or parturition. The levatores ani and coccygei together form a muscular diaphragm which supports the pelvic viscera. \r\n  \r\n', NULL, ' Access to surgery ,500 SBA in basic and applied anatomy, Shazad G.

Eventually, the needle pierces the sacrospinous ligament, at which point the pudendal nerve is bathed with anaesthetic. Remember: the pudendal nerve is within the pudendal canal and it wraps around the ischial spine before it delivers its branches. Therefore, administering the nerve block at the ischial spine allows an anaesthetist to anaesthetise all the branches of the pudendal nerve. This is a very important landmark, which you want to remember! Also remember: the pudendal nerve block does not need to be administered transvaginally. In a perineal pudendal nerve block, the ischial tuberosity is palpated through the buttock and the needle is inserted into the pudendal canal about 2.4 cm deep medial to the ischial tuberosity. The anaesthetic can then be injected to bathe the pudendal nerve. In this case, a different anatomical landmark, the ischial tuberosity, is used to deliver the nerve block.

If the incision tears further during the delivery, a median incision is more likely than a posterolateral incision to extend posteriorly through the external anal sphincter and the rectum. A posterolateral incision is much safer! The bulbospongiosus muscle, ischiocavernosus muscle and sphincter urethrae are anterior to the area that is cut during an episiotomy.

The pterygopalatine ganglion (or sphenopalatine ganglion) is a parasympathetic ganglion found in the pterygopalatine fossa. The pterygopalatine ganglion (the ganglion of Meckel) is the largest of the parasympathetic ganglia that are associated with the branches of the trigeminal nerve. It is deeply placed in the pterygopalatine fossa, close to the sphenopalatine foramen. It is triangular or heart-shaped, reddish-grey in colour, and is situated just below the maxillary nerve as it crosses the fossa. \r\nThe pterygopalatine ganglion supplies the lacrimal gland, paranasal sinuses, glands of the mucosa of the nasal cavity and pharynx, the gums, and the mucous membrane and glands of the hard palate. It communicates anteriorly with the nasopalatine nerve. The pterygopalatine ganglion receives a sensory, a motor, and a sympathetic root. Its sensory root is derived from two sphenopala tine branches of the maxillary nerve: although the majority of their fibres pass directly into the palatine nerves, some enter the ganglion, forming its sensory root. Its motor root is derived from the nervus intermedius (a part of the facial nerve) through the greater petrosal nerve. In the pterygopalatine ganglion, the parasympathetic fibres form synapses with neurones whose postganglionic axons, vasodilator and secretory fibres, are distributed with the deep branches of the trigeminal nerve to the mucous membrane of the nose, soft palate, tonsils, uvula, roof of the mouth, upper lip and gums, and to the upper part of the pharynx. It also distributes postganglionic parasympathetic fibres to the lacrimal gland through the zygomatic nerve, a branch of the maxillary nerve (from the trigeminal nerve), which then connects with the lacrimal nerve (a branch of the ophthalmic nerve, also part of the trigeminal nerve) to arrive at the lacrimal gland. The ganglion also consists of sympathetic efferent (postganglionic) fibres from the superior cervical ganglion.

Its name derives from the fact that it has three major branches: (i) the ophthalmic nerve (V1); (ii) the maxillary nerve (V2); and (iii) the mandibular nerve (V3). The ophthalmic and maxillary nerves are purely sensory. The mandibular nerve has both sensory and motor functions. The three branches converge on the trigeminal ganglion (also called the semilunar ganglion or Gasserian an lion hick contains the cell bo\'§—ot incoming sensory nerve fibres. The trigeminal ganglion is analogous to the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord, which contain the cell bodies of incoming sensory fibres from the rest of the body. From the trigeminal ganglion, a single large sensory root enters the brainstem at the level of the pons.. Immediately adjacent to the sensory root, a smaller motor root emerges from the pons at the same level. Motor fibres pass through the trigeminal ganglion on their way to peripheral muscles, but their cell bodies are located in the motor nucleus of the fifth nerve, deep within the pons. Motor fibres are distributed (together with sensory fibres) in branches of the mandibular nerve. The sensory function of the trigeminal nerve is to provide the tactile, proprioceptive and nociceptive afference of the face and mouth. The posterior scalp and the neck are innervated by C2—C3, not by the trigeminal nerve. The brain parenchyma itself does not have sensory receptors, but the meninges do. The areas of cutaneous distribution (dermatomes) of the three branches of the trigeminal nerve have sharp borders with relatively little overlap (unlike dermatomes in the rest of the body, which show considerable overlap). Injection of local anaesthetics such as lidocaine results in complete loss of sensation from well-defined areas of the face and mouth. For example, the teeth on one side of the jaw can be numbed by injecting the mandibular nerve. \r\n', NULL, ' Access to surgery ,500 SBA in basic and applied anatomy, Shazad G.

From its anterior part arise the two anterior cerebrals, from its anterolateral parts arise the middl erebrals, and from its posterior part arise the posterior cerebrals Each of these principal arteries gives origin to two different systems of secondary vessels. One of these is the ganglionic system and this supplies the thalami and corpora striata. The other is the cortical system whose vessels ramify in the pia mater and supply the cortex and subjacent brain substance. These ganglionic and cortical systems do not communicate at any point of their peripheral distribution, resulting in the presence of a watershed area between the parts supplied by the two systems] \r\n\r\n', NULL, ' Access to surgery ,500 SBA in basic and applied anatomy, Shazad G.

(346, '1', 'To test for trochlear nerve (cranial nerve IV) damage, have the patient gaze:', 'A', '', 'Answer: A In (medially), then down \r\nThe trochlear nerve (the fourth cranial nerve, also called the fourth nerve or simply IV) is a motor nerve (a \'somatic efferent\' nerve) that innervates a single muscle: the superior oblique muscle of the eye. An older name is the pathetic nerve, which refers to the dejected appearance (head bent forward) that is characteristic of patients with fourth nerve palsies. The trochlear nerve is unique among the cranial nerves in several respects. It Is the smallest nerve in terms of the number of axons it contains. It has the greatest intracranial length. It is the only cranial nerve that decussates (crosses to the other side) before innervating its target. Finally, it is the only cranial nerve that exits from the dorsal aspect of the brainstem. To understand the actions of the superior oblique muscle, it is useful to imagine the eyeball as a sphere that is constrained — like the trackball of a computer mouse — in such a way that only certain rotational movements are possible. Allowable movements for the superior oblique are: (i) rotation in a vertical plane — looking down and up (depression and elevation of the eyeball) and (ii) rotation in the plane of the face (intorsion and extorsion of the eyeball). The body of the superior oblique muscle is located behind the eyeball, but the tendon (which is redirected by the trochlea) approaches the eyeball from the front. The tendon attaches to the top (superior aspect) of the eyeball at an angle of 51° with respect to the primary position of the eye (looking straight forward). The force of the tendon\'s pull therefore has two components: a forward component that tends to pull the eyeball downward (depression) and a medial component that tends to rotate the top of the eyeball toward the nose (intorsion). The relative strength of these two forces depends on which way the eye is looking. When the eye is adducted (looking toward the nose) the force of depression increases. When the eye is abducted (looking away from the nose), the force of intorsion increases, while the force of depression decreases. When the eye is in the primary position (looking straight ahead) contraction of the superior oblique produces depression and intorsion in roughly equal amounts. \r\nTo summarise, the actions of the superior oblique muscle are: depression of the eyeball, especially when the eye is adducted; and intorsion of the eyeball, especially when the eye is abducted. The clinical consequences of weakness in the superior oblique (caused, for example, by fourth nerve palsies) are discussed below. This summary of the superior oblique muscle describes its most important functions. However, it is an oversimplification of the actual situation. For example, the tendon of the superior oblique inserts behind the \'equator of the eyeball in the frontal plane, so contraction of the muscle also tends to abduct the eyeball (turn it outward). In fact, each of the six extraocular muscles exerts rotational forces in all three planes (elevation—depression, adduction—abduction, intorsion—extorsion) to varying degrees, depending on which way the eye is looking. The relative forces change every time the eyeball moves — every time the direction of gaze changes. The central control of this process, which involves the continuous, precise adjustment of forces on twelve different tendons to point both eyes in exactly the same direction, is truly remarkable. \r\nInjury to the trochlear nerve causes weakness of downward eye movement with consequent vertical diplopia (double vision). The affected eye drifts upward relative to the normal eye, due to the unopposed actions of the remaining extraocular muscles. The patient sees two visual fields (one from each eye), separated vertically. To compensate for this, patients learn to tilt the head forward (tuck the chin in) to bring the fields back together — to fuse the two images into a single visual field. This accounts for the \'dejected\' appearance of patients with \'pathetic nerve\' palsies. \r\nAs would be expected, the diplopia gets worse when the affected eye looks toward the nose — the contribution of the superior oblique muscle to downward gaze is greater in this position. Common activities requiring this type of convergent gaze are reading the newspaper and walking down stairs. Diplopia associated with these activities may be the initial symptom of a fourth nerve palsy. Trochlear nerve palsy also affects torsion (rotation of the eyeball in the plane of the face). Torsion is a normal response to tilting the head sideways. The eyes automatically rotate in an equal and opposite direction, so that the orientation of the environment remains unchanged — vertical things remain vertical. Weakness of intorsion results in torsional diplopia, in which two different visual fields, tilted with respect to each other, are seen at the same time. To compensate for this, patients with trochlear nerve palsies tilt their heads to the opposite side, to fuse the two images into a single visual field. The characteristic appearance of patients with fourth nerve palsies (head tilted to one side, chin tucked in) suggests the diagnosis, but other causes must be ruled out. For example, torticollis can produce a similar appearance. \r\n', NULL, ' Access to surgery ,500 SBA in basic and applied anatomy, Shazad G.

On emerging from the hypoglossal canal, the nerve picks up a branch from the anterior ramus of Cl. It spirals behind the vagus nerve and passes between the internal carotid artery and the internal jugular vein lying on the carotid sheath. After passing deep to the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, it passes to the tongue. It supplies motor fibres to all of the muscles of the tongue, except the palatoglossus, which is innervated by the vagus nerve (X). To test the function of the nerve, a person is asked to poke out their tongue. If there is a loss of function on one side (unilateral paralysis) the tongue will point towards the affected side. The strength of the tongue can be tested by getting the person to poke at the inside of their cheek and feeling how strongly they can push a finger pushed against their cheek — a more elegant way of testing than directly touching the tongue.

The nerve injured is the:', 'A', '', 'Answer: A Accessory \r\nThe accessory nerve innervates the trapezius muscle, which is the muscle responsible for elevating the acromion of the scapula, also known as the tip of the shoulder. If a patient has damaged her accessory nerve, she will be unable to elevate her acromion. The dorsal scapular nerve innervates three muscles: rhomboideus major rhomboideus minor and the lower portion of levator scapulae. The rhomboids and trapezius retract the scapula toward the midline. Therefore, if the dorsal scapular nerve is injured and the rhomboids are paralysed, retraction of the scapula on the affected side will be weakened. The greater occipital nerve supplies cutaneous sensation to the posterior scalp. Damage to the greater occipital nerve would not result in any loss of muscular function. Spinal nerve C4 refers to the nerve formed by the dorsal and ventral roots of C4. This nerve does not innervate trapezius. Although branches from the ventral primary rami of C3 and C4 combine with the accessory nerve to form the subtrapezial plexus, C3 and C4 provide only proprioception and are not involved with the motion of the trapezius. Finally, the thoracodorsal nerve innervates latissimus dorsi. Latissimus dorsi is the muscle used to extend the arm or raise the trunk to the arms, as if climbing or doing chin-ups.

The word "meiosis" comes from the Greek meioun, meaning "to make smaller,\' since it results in a reduction in chromosome number. Meiosis is essential for sexual reproduction. It therefore occurs in most eukaryotes, including single-celled organisms. Meiosis does not occur in archea or prokaryotes, which reproduce by asexual cell division processes. Meiosis has two stages: meiosis I and meiosis II. Meiosis I consists of segregating the homologous chromosomes from each other, then dividing the tetraploid cell into two diploid cells each containing one of the segregates. Meiosis II consists of decoupling each chromosome\'s sister strands (chromatids), segregating the DNA into two sets of strands (each set containing one of each homolog), and dividing both diploid cells to produce four haploid cells. Meiosis I and II are both divided into prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase subphases, similar in purpose to their analogous subphases in the mitotic cell cycle.

It is a monosynaptic reflex that provides automatic regulation of skeletal muscle length. Muscle spindles are sense organs sensitive to stretch of the muscle in which they lie. The patellar (knee-jerk) reflex is an example. Another example is the group la fibres in the calf muscle, which synapse with motor neurones supplying muscle fibres in the same muscle. A sudden stretch, such as tapping the Achilles\' tendon, causes a reflex contraction in the muscle as the spindles sense the stretch and send an action potential to the motor neurones, which then cause the muscle to contract; this particular reflex causes a contraction in the soleus—gastrocnemius group of muscles.

(457, '1', 'Atractyloside is an inhibitor of the electron transport chain. It would be expected to have little or no effect on the functioning of which of the following cell types?', 'E', '', 'Answer: E Red blood cells \r\nAn electron transport chain (also called electron transport system or electron transfer chain) is a series of membrane-associated electron carriers mediating biochemical reactions that produce ATP, which is the energy currency of life. Only two sources of energy are available to living organisms: oxidation—reduction (redox) reactions and sunlight (photosynthesis). Organisms that use redox reactions to produce ATP are called chemotrophs, Organisms that use sunlight are called phototrophs. Both chemotrophs and phototrophs utilise electron transport chains to convert energy into ATP. The overall purpose of the electron transport chain is to create ATP using energy contained in high-energy electrons. \r\nThis is achieved through a three-step process: Gradually sap energy from a high-energy electron in a series of individual steps. \r\n• Use that energy to forcibly unbalance the proton concentration across the membrane. \r\n• Use the proton concentration\'s drive to rebalance itself as a means of producing ATP. \r\nElectron transport chains are present in the mitochondria. Energy sources such as glucose are initially metabolised in the cytoplasm. The products are imported into mitochondria. Mitochondria continue the process of catabolism using metabolic pathways including the Krebs cycle, fatty acid oxidation and amino acid oxidation. The end-result of these pathways is the production of two energy-rich electron donors, NADH and FADH2. Electrons from these donors are passed through an electron transport chain to oxygen, which is reduced to water. This is a multi-step redox process that occurs on the mitochondrial inner membrane. The enzymes that catalyse these reactions have the remarkable ability to simultaneously create a proton gradient across the membrane, producing a thermodynamically unlikely high-energy state with the potential to do work. Although electron transport occurs with great efficiency, a small percentage of electrons are prematurely leaked to oxygen, resulting in the formation of the toxic free radical, superoxide. Four membrane-bound complexes have been identified in mitochondria. Each is an extremely complex transmembrane structure that is embedded in the inner membrane. Three of them are proton pumps. The structures are electrically connected by lipid-soluble electron carriers and water-soluble electron carriers. The overall electron transport chain is: \r\nNADH  Complex I  Q Complex Ill  Cytochrome c Complex IV O2 \r\n						\r\nComplex II \r\n\r\nMuch of our knowledge of mitochondrial function results from the study of toxic compounds. Specific inhibitors were used to distinguish the electron transport system from the phosphorylation system and helped to define the sequence of redox carriers along the respiratory chain. If the chain is blocked then all the intermediates on the substrate side of the block become more reduced, while all those on the oxygen side become more oxidised. It is easy to see what has happened, because the oxidised and reduced carriers often differ in their spectral properties. If a variety of different inhibitors are available then many of the respiratory carriers can be placed in the correct order. Atractyloside transport inhibitor blocks the adenine nucleotide porter by binding to the outward-facing conformation (contrast with bongkrekic acid). It has no effect on submitochondrial particles, which re-seal spontaneously after sonication with the membranes inside-out. This ATP/ADP transport inhibitor resembles oligomycin when used with intact mitochondria. Of all the options given in this question, red blood cells are the only cell type that do not have mitochondria and hence will not be affected by electron transport chain inhibitor, atractyloside. \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology, Shazad G.

Fast muscle fibres:', 'A', '', 'Answer: A Use anaerobic metabolism \r\nSkeletal muscle fibres can be divided into two basic types, type I (slow-twitch fibres) and type II (fast-twitch fibres). Type I muscle fibres (slow-oxidative fibres) use primarily cellular respiration and,\' as a result, have relatively high endurance. To support their high-oxidative metabolism, these muscle fibres typically have lots of mitochondria and myoglobin and so appear red or what is typically termed \'dark\' meat in poultry. Type I muscle fibres are typically found in muscles of animals that require endurance, such as chicken leg muscles or the wing muscles of migrating birds (eg, geese). Type II muscle fibres use primarily anaerobic metabolism and have relatively low endurance. These muscle fibres are typically used during tasks requiring short bursts of strength, such as sprints or weightlifting. Type II muscle fibres cannot sustain contractions for significant lengths of time and are typically found in the \'white\' meat (eg, the breast) of chicken. \r\nThere are two subclasses of type II muscle fibres, type Ila (fast-oxidative) and Ilb (fast-glycolytic). The Type IIa fast-oxidative fibres \' actually also appear red, due to their high content of myoglobin and mitochondria. Type Ilb (fast-glycolytic) tire the fastest and are the prevalent type in sedentary individuals. These fibres appear white histologically, due to their low oxidative demand, manifested by the lack of myoglobulin and mitochondria (relative to the type I and type Ila fibres). Some research suggests that these subtypes can switch with training to some degree. The biochemical difference between the three types of muscle fibres is in their myosin heavy chains. \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G.

(460, '1', 'A patient developed a stitch granuloma following surgery. Which leukocyte in the peripheral blood will become an activated macrophage in this  granuloma?', 'D', '', 'Answer: D Monocyte \r\nA monocyte is a leukocyte, part of the human body\'s immune system that protects against blood-borne pathogens and moves quickly (approx. 8-12 hours) to sites of infection in the tissues. Monocytes are usually identified in stained smears by their large bilobed nucleus. They are produced by the bone marrow from haemopoietic stem cell precursors called monoblasts. Monocytes circulate in the bloodstream for about one to three days and then typically move into tissues throughout the body. They consist of between 3 and 8% of the leukocytes in the blood. In the tissues, monocytes mature into different types of macrophages at different anatomical locations. Monocytes are responsible for phagocytosis (ingestion) of foreign substances in the body. Monocytes can perform phagocytosis using intermediary (opsonising) proteins such as antibodies or complement that coat the pathogen, as well as by binding to the microbe directly via pattern-recognition receptors that recognise pathogens. Monocytes are also capable of killing infected host cells via antibody, termed antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity. Vacuolisation may be present in a cell that has phagocytosed foreign matter. \r\n\r\nMonocytes that migrate from the bloodstream to other tissues are called macrophages. Macrophages are responsible for protecting tissues from foreign substances, but are also suspected to be the predominant cells involved in triggering atherosclerosis. They are cells that possess a large smooth nucleus, a large area of cytoplasm and many internal vesicles for processing foreign material. A monocyte count is part of a complete blood count and is expressed either as a ratio of monocytes to the total number of white blood cells counted or by absolute numbers. Both may be useful in determining or refuting a possible diagnosis. Monocytosis is the state of excess monocytes in the peripheral blood. It may be indicative of various disease states. Examples of processes that can increase a monocyte count include: \r\n• chronic inflammation \r\n• stress response \r\n• hyperadrenocorticisrn \r\n• immune-mediated disease \r\n• pyogranulomatous disease \r\n• necrosis \r\n• red cell regeneration. \r\n \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G.

(464, '1', 'In humans there are five types of antibody: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and 1gM. Which of the following statements regarding IgM is CORRECT?', 'C', '', 'Answer: C It is the largest immunoglobin molecule \r\nIgM forms polymers where multiple immunoglobulins are covalently linked together with disulphide bonds, normally as a pentamer or occasionally as a hexamer. It has a large molecular mass of approximately 900 kDa (in its pentamer form). The J chain is attached to most pentamers, while hexamers do not possess the J chain due to space constraints in the complex. Because each monomer has two antigen binding sites, an IgM has 10 of them; however, it cannot bind 10 antigens at the same time because they hinder each other. Because it is a large molecule, it cannot diffuse well and is found in the interstitium only in very low quantities. IgM is primarily found in serum; however, because of the J chain, it is also important as a secretory immunoglobulin. Due to its polymeric nature, IgM possesses high avidity and is particularly effective at complement activation. It is sometimes called a \'natural antibody\', but it is likely that the antibodies arise due to sensitisation in the very young to antigens that are naturally occurring in nature. For example anti-A and anti-B IgM antibodies can be formed in early life as a result of exposure to anti-A- and anti-B-like substances that are present on bacteria or perhaps also on plant materials. In germ-line cells, the gene segment encoding the p. constant region of the heavy chain is positioned first among other constant-region gene segments. For this reason, IgM is the first immunoglobulin expressed by mature B cells. \r\nIgM is also by far the physically largest antibody in the circulation. IgM antibodies are mainly responsible for the clumping (agglutination) of red blood cells if the recipient of a blood transfusion receives blood that is not compatible with his/her blood type. IgM antibodies appear early in the course of an infection and usually do not reappear after further exposure. IgM antibodies do not pass across the human placenta. These two biological properties of IgM make it useful in the diagnosis of infectious diseases.

(465, '1', 'The lack of normal factor VIII causes haemophilia A, an inherited bleeding disorder. Factor VIII is synthesised predomioantly in:', 'E', '', 'Answer: E Vascular endothelium \r\nFactor VIII (FVIII) is an essential clotting factor. The lack of normal FVIII causes haemophilia A, an inherited bleeding disorder. The gene for Factor VIII is located on the X chromosome (Xq28). FVIII is a glycoprotein pro-cofactor. Factor VIII is synthesised predominantly in the vascular endothelium and is not affected by liver disease. In fact, levels usually are elevated in such instances. It is also synthesised and released into the bloodstream by the liver. In the circulating blood, it is mainly bound to von Willebrand factor (vWF, also known as factor VIII-related antigen) to form a stable complex. Upon activation by thrombin or factor Xa, it dissociates from the complex to interact with factor IXa in the coagulation cascade. It is a co-factor to factor IXa in the activation of factor X, which, in turn, with its co-factor factor Va, activates more thrombin. Thrombin cleaves fibrinogen into fibrin, which polymerises and crosslinks (using factor XIII) into a blood clot. No longer protected by vWF, activated FVIII is proteolytically inactivated in the process (most prominently by activated protein C and factor IXa) and quickly cleared from the bloodstream. FVIII concentrated from donated blood plasma or alternatively recombinant FVIII can be given to haemophiliacs to restore haemostasis. So, FVIII is also known as antihaemophilic factor. The transfer of a plasma by-product into the bloodstream of a patient with haemophilia often led to the transmission of diseases such as HIV and hepatitis before purification methods were improved. In the early 1990s, pharmaceutical companies began to produce recombinant synthesised factor products, which now prevent nearly all forms of disease transmission during replacement therapy. \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G.

It arises from a qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion. It is known to affect humans and, in veterinary medicine, dogs. There are three types of hereditary vWD, but other factors-such as ABO blood group may also play a part in the cause of the condition. The various types of vWD present with varying degrees of bleeding tendency. Severe internal or joint bleeding is rare (only in type 3 vWD); bruising, nosebleeds, heavy menstrual periods (in women) and blood loss during childbirth (rare) may occur. Death may occur The vWFgene is located on chromosome 12 (12p13.2). It has 52 exons spanning 178 kbp. Types 1 and 2 are inherited as autosomal dominant traits and type 3 is inherited as autosomal recessive. Occasionally type 2 also inherits recessively. In humans, the incidence of vWD is roughly about 1 in 100 individuals. Because most forms are rather mild, they are detected more often in women, whose bleeding tendency shows during menstruation. The actual abnormality (which does not necessarily lead to disease) occurs in 0.9-3% of the population. It may be more severe or apparent in people with blood group 0. Acquired vWD can occur in patients with autoantibodies. In this case the function of vWF is not inhibited but the vWF—antibody complex is rapidly cleared from the circulation. A form of vWD occurs in patients with aortic valve stenosis, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding (Heyde\'s syndrome). This form of acquired vWD may be more prevalent than is presently thought. Acquired vWF has also been described in the following disorders: Wilms\' tumour, hypothyroidism and mesenchymal dysplasias. Patients with vWD normally require no regular treatment, although they are always at increased risk for bleeding. Prophylactic treatment is sometimes given for patients with vWD who are scheduled for surgery. They can be treated with human-derived medium purity factor VIII concentrates. Mild cases of vWD can be trialled on desmopressin (1-desamino-8-o-arginine vasopressin, DDAVP) (antihaemophilic factor, more commonly known as humate-P), which works by raising the patient\'s own plasma levels of vWF by inducing release of vWF stored in the Weibel—Palade bodies in the endothelial cells. \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G.

The AV node receives two inputs from the atria: posteriorly via the crista terminalis and anteriorly via the interatrial septum. An important property that is unique to the AV node is decremental conduction. This is the property of the AV node that prevents rapid conduction to the ventricle in cases of rapid atrial rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. The AV node functions as a critical delay in the conduction system. Without this delay, the atria and ventricles would contract at the same time and blood would not flow effectively from the atria to the ventricles.

It was estimated that about 20% blood volume had been lost due to acute haemorrhage. It is true to say that in this patient:', 'C', '', 'Answer: C Plasma vasopressin is increased in response to reduced ECF volume \r\nThe vascularly generated shock is caused by loss of blood or other fluids (absolute hypovolaemia) or by vasodilatation (relative hypovolaemia). Absolute hypovolaemia is caused by blood loss, plasma loss (burns or other denuding conditions, ascites, hydrothorax etc) or dehydration (water deprivation, severe diarrhoea or vomiting, excessive sweating, intestinal obstruction with lurninal fluid accumulation, urinary loss of proteins/salt/water, excessive use of diuretics, hypoaldosteronism etc). Relative hypovolaemia, sometimes with universal vasodilatation, is caused by endotoxins (septic shock from viral or bacterial infections) anaphylactic shock or by a neurogenic vasodilatation (neurogenic shock by severe pains or stress, anaesthetics or brainstem lesions close to the vasoconstrictor centre). \r\n\r\nThe reduced delivery of oxygen and nutrients to virtually all cells of the body is consequential: The mitochondria synthesise less ATP, the Na+-K pump operates insufficiently, the metabolic processing of nutrients is depressed, which profoundly depresses muscular contractions and finally digestive enzymes destroy the damaged cells. Glucose transport across the cell membranes in the liver and in the skeletal muscles is depressed, including a severe inhibition of the actions of insulin and other hormones. During progressive shock the metabolism is reduced and so also heat energy, so the body temperature tends to decrease, if the patient is not kept warm. Compensatory mechanisms in shock are called negative feedback mechanisms, because they operate to counteract the fall in blood pressure. Baroreceptor responses and many hormonal control systems, that tend to raise the falling blood pressure, are examples of negative feedback. The gain of a feedback system is defined as the ratio of the response to the stimulus itself. Decompensatory mechanisms exaggerate the primary fall in blood pressure. This is called positive feedback. A positive feedback mechanism can lead to a vicious cycle and death, if its gain is above one. Two examples of positive feedback in shock are ischaemic brainstem depression and cardiac depression. \r\nMild shock is a condition where compensatory reactions can cure the patient without external help. A latent shock is produced when a healthy blood donor delivers more than the usual 500 ml of blood for transfusion, but the volume is often replaced within an hour. A number of negative feedback mechanisms oppose the induced changes of shock. The falls in MAP and pulse pressure reduce the stimulation of the high-pressure baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and the aortic arch. The negative stimulation of the cardiovascular control centres in the brainstem enhances the sympathetic tone (and reduces the vagal tone), leading to increased heart rate and contractility as well as to arteriolar and venous constriction mainly in the skin, skeletal muscles and the splanchnic area. The blood flow favours the brain and the heart as long as possible. \r\nReduced capillary pressure with autotransfusion from the interstitial fluid, thirst and drinking followed by absorption of fluid from the gastrointestinal tract and release of powerful vasoconstrictors such as adrenaline, angiotensin II, vasopressin etc are all compensatory mechanisms that counteract shock. \r\n\r\nCatecholamines and enkephalins are released from chromaff in granules in the adrenal medulla. Catecholamines increase the heart rate and the cardiac output by stimulation of the adrenergic receptors in the myocardium. Catecholamines constrict vessels all over the body by stimulating a,-receptors located on the surface of vascular smooth muscles. \r\n\r\nADH (vasopressin) is secreted from the posterior pituitary gland in response to shock, because the sinoaortic baroreceptors are under-stimulated. Vasopressin is a modest vasoconstrictor and a strong antidiuretic hormone. The increased ADH secretion causes increased I fluid reabsorption by the kidneys and restores blood pressure and volume. \r\nRenin is secreted from the juxtaglomerular apparatus, when blood pressure and renal perfusion fall drastically. Renin acts on the plasma protein, angiotensinogen, to form inactive angiotensin I, which is transformed to the powerful vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II by angiotensin converting enzyme, ACE. Angiotensin II is a powerful dipsogen and increases thirst sensation. The rise in normal plasma potassium due to the ischaemia of shock also releases aldosterone, which promotes potassium loss from the kidney by acting on mineralocorticoid receptors on principal cells in the distal tubule of the nephron. ACTH and 0-endorphins are released into the blood from the anterior pituitary gland in response to haemorrhage or other forms of stress. ACTH and endorphins both exaggerate and restrict the development of shock. These opioids depress the brainstem control centres that normally mediate autonomic responses to stress. Hence, naloxone (an opioid antagonist) improves the circulation and increases the rate of survival from life-threatening shock. On the other hand, ACTH has a small aldosterone- and a strong cortisol-stimulating effect. \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G. Raja', '2017-11-29 06:47:46', 'admin@bigm-bd.com', NULL, NULL, '1'),

It is true to say that in this patient:', 'D', '', 'Answer:D  The skin vessels are constricted \r\nIn haemorrhagic shock, blood loss exceeds the body\'s ability to compensate and provide adequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation. This frequently is due to trauma, but it may be caused by spontaneous haemorrhage (eg, gastrointestinal [Cl] bleeding, childbirth), surgery and other causes. Most frequently, clinical haemorrhagic shock is caused by an acute bleeding episode with a discrete precipitating event. Less commonly, haemorrhagic shock may be seen in chronic conditions with subacute blood loss. Well described responses to acute loss of circulating volume exist. Teleologically, these responses act systematically to divert circulating volume away from non-vital organ systems so that blood volume may be conserved for vital organ function. Acute haemorrhage causes a decreased cardiac output and decreased pulse pressure. These changes are sensed by baroreceptors in the aortic arch and atrium. With a decrease in the circulating volume, neural reflexes cause an increased sympathetic outflow to the heart and other organs. The response is an increase in heart rate, vasoconstriction and redistribution of blood flow away from certain non-vital organs such as the skin, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys. \r\n\r\nConcurrently, a multisystem hormonal response to acute haemorrhage occurs. Corticotropin-releasing hormone is stimulated directly. This eventually leads to glucocorticoid and 0-endorphin release. Vasopressin from the posterior pituitary is released, causing water retention at the distal tubules. Renin is released by the juxtamedullary complex in response to decreased mean arterial pressure, leading to increased aldosterone levels and eventually to sodium and water resorption. Hyperglycaemia commonly is associated with acute haemorrhage. This is due to a glucagon-and growth-hormone-induced increase in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Circulating catecholamines relatively inhibit insulin release and activity, leading to increased plasma glucose. \r\nIn addition to these global changes, many organ-specific responses occur. The brain has remarkable autoregulation that keeps cerebral blood flow constant over a wide range of systemic mean arterial blood pressures. The kidneys can tolerate a 90% decrease in total blood flow for short periods of time. With significant decreases in circulatory volume, intestinal blood flow is dramatically reduced by splanchnic vasoconstriction. Early and appropriate resuscitation may avert damage to individual organs as adaptive mechanisms act to preserve the organism. Age, medications and co-morbid factors all may affect a patient\'s response to haemorrhagic shock. Failure of compensatory mechanisms in haemorrhagic shock can lead to death. Without intervention, a classic trimodal distribution of deaths is seen in severe haemorrhagic shock. An initial peak of mortality occurs within minutes of haemorrhage due to immediate exsanguination. Another peak occurs after 1 to several hours due to progressive decompensation. A third peak occurs days to weeks later due to sepsis and organ failure (see also answer to 2.4). \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G.

(501, '1', 'Which of the following compensatory factors is responsible for increasing the blood pressure in a 35-year-old patient who is in shock with blood pressure of 50 mmHg?', 'B', '', 'Answer: B Baroceptor reflex \r\nIn cardiovascular physiology, the baroreflex or baroreceptor reflex is one of the body\'s homeostatic mechanisms for maintaining blood pressure. It provides a negative feedback loop in which an elevated blood pressure reflexively causes blood pressure to decrease; similarly, decreased blood pressure depresses the baroreflex, causing blood pressure to rise. The system relies on specialised neurones (baroreceptors) in the aortic arch, carotid sinuses and elsewhere to monitor changes in blood pressure and relay them to the brainstem. Subsequent changes in blood pressure are mediated by the autonomic nervous system. Baroreceptors include those in the auricles of the heart and vena cavae, but the most sensitive baroreceptors are in the carotid sinuses and aortic arch. The carotid sinus baroreceptors are innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX); the aortic arch baroreceptors are innervated by the vagus nerve (CN X). Baroreceptor activity travels along these nerves, which contact the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) in the brainstem. \r\nThe baroreceptors are stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors. When blood pressure rises, the carotid and aortic sinuses are distended, resulting in stretch and therefore activation of the baroreceptors. Active baroreceptors fire action potentials (\'spikes\') more frequently than inactive baroreceptors. The greater the stretch, the.more rapidly baroreceptors fire action potentials. These action potentials are relayed to the NTS, which uses spike frequency as a surrogate measure of blood pressure. Increased activation of the NTS inhibits the vasomotor centre and stimulates the vagal nuclei. The end result of baroreceptor activation is inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system and activation of the parasympathetic nervous system. \r\nThe sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system have opposing effects on blood pressure. Sympathetic activation `leads to increased contractility of the heart, increased heart rate, venoconstriction and arterial Vasoconstriction, which tend to increase blood pressure by elevating both total peripheral resistance and cardiac output. Conversely, parasympathetic activation leads to a decrease in heart rate and a minor decrease in contractility, resulting in a decreased cardiac output and therefore a tendency to decrease blood pressure. \r\nBy coupling sympathetic inhibition with parasympathetic activation, the baroreflex maximises its ability to reduce blood pressure. Sympathetic inhibition leads to a drop in total peripheral resistance and cardiac output, while parasympathetic activation leads to a depressed heart rate and reduced cardiac contractility. The combined effects will dramatically decrease blood pressure. Similarly, coupling sympathetic activation with parasympathetic inhibition allows the baroreflex to elevate blood pressure effectively. Sympathetic activation increases total peripheral resistance and elevates cardiac output, the latter being enhanced by inhibition of the parasympathetic nervous system. Baroreceptors are tonically active at mean arterial pressures (MAP) above approximately 70 mmHg, called the baroreceptor set point. When MAP falls below the set point, baroreceptors are essentially silent. The baroreceptor set point is not fixed; its value may change with changes in blood pressure that persist for 1-2 days. For example, in chronic hypertension, the set point will increase; on the other hand, chronic hypotension will result in a depression of the baroreceptor set point. At a MAP below approximately 50 mmHg, baroreceptors are completely silent. The baroreflex may also be responsible for a part of the low-frequency component of heart rate variability, the so called Mayer waves. \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G.

It is a powerful dipsogen. It is derived from the precursor molecule angiotensinogen, a serum globulin produced in the liver. It plays an important role in the renin—angiotensin system. Angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II through removal of two terminal residues by the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE or kininase), which is found predominantly in the capillaries of the lung. ACE is a target for inactivation by ACE inhibitor drugs, which decrease the rate of angiotensin II production. Other cleavage products, seven or nine amino acids long, are also known; they have differential affinity for angiotensin receptors, although their exact role is still unclear. The action of angiotensin II itself is targeted by angiotensin Il receptor antagonists, which directly block angiotensin II AT1 receptors. Angiotensin II is degraded to angiotensin III by angiotensinases that are located in red blood cells and the vascular beds of most tissues. It has a half-life in circulation of around 30 s, while in tissue it may be as long as 15-30 min. Angiotensin II has a number of effects throughout the body. These include: \r\nCardiovascular effects \r\n• It is a potent direct vasoconstrictor, constricting arteries and veins and increasing blood pressure. \r\n• Angiotensin II has prothrombotic potential through adhesion and aggregation of platelets and production of PAI-1 and PAI-2. \r\n• It has been proposed that angiotensin II could be a cause of vascular and cardiac muscle hypertrophy. \r\nNeural effects \r\n• Angiotensin II increases thirst sensation (dipsogen) through the subfornical organ of the brain, decreases the response of the baroreceptor reflex and increases the desire for salt. \r\n• It increases secretion of ADH in the posterior pituitary and secretion of ACTH in the anterior pituitary. \r\n• It also potentiates the release of noradrenaline by direct action on postganglionic sympathetic fibres. Adrenal effects \r\n• Angiotensin II acts on the adrenal cortex, causing it to release aldosterone, a hormone that causes the kidneys to retain sodium and lose potassium. \r\n• Elevated plasma angiotensin II levels are responsible for the elevated aldosterone levels present during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. \r\n \r\nRenal effects \r\n• Angiotensin II has a direct effect on the proximal tubules to increase Na\' resorption. \r\n• Although it slightly inhibits glomerular filtration by indirectly (through sympathetic effects) and directly stimulating mesangial cell constriction, its overall effect is to increase the glomerular filtration rate by increasing the renal perfusion pressure via efferent renal arteriole constriction. \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G.

Its primary cause is loss of fluid from the circulation from either an internal or external source. An internal source may be haemorrhage. External causes may include extensive bleeding, high-output fistulae or severe burns. The management of shock requires immediate intervention, even before a diagnosis is made. Re-establishing perfusion to the organs is the primary goal through restoring and maintaining the blood circulating volume, ensuring oxygenation and blood pressure are adequate, achieving and maintaining effective cardiac function and preventing complications. In hypovolaemic shock, caused by bleeding, it is necessary to control the bleeding immediately and restore the victim\'s blood volume by giving infusions of balanced salt solutions. Blood transfusions are necessary for loss of large amounts of blood (eg, greater than 20% of blood volume), but can be avoided in smaller and slower losses. Hypovolaemic shock due to burns, diarrhoea, vomiting, etc is treated with infusions of electrolyte solutions that balance the nature of the fluid lost. Sodium is essential to keep the fluid infused in the extracellular and intravascular space while preventing water intoxication and brain swelling. Metabolic acidosis (mainly due to lactic acid) develops as a result of poor delivery of oxygen to the tissues and mirrors the severity of the shock.

Atrial fibrillation is often asymptomatic, but may result in symptoms of palpitations, fainting, chest pain or even heart failure.

Which of the following could be a major stimulus for the release of renin from the juxtaglomerular apparatus in this patient?', 'D', '', 'Answer: D Increased sympathetic activity via renal nerves \r\nRenin, also known as angiotensinogenase, is a circulating enzyme released mainly by juxtaglomerular cells in the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) of the kidneys in response to low blood volume or low body NaCI content, mediated through the rapid release of prostaglandins. Although it has hormone-like actions, it cleaves a protein precursor in the circulation rather than working on a cellular target so it is not truly a hormone. Sympathetic activation of membrane13, and cyadrenergic receptors on JGA cells also causes renin release, probably by altering tubular sodium content or macula densa function. The normal concentration in human plasma is 1.0— 2.5 ng/ml/h. Fifteen per cent of patients with essential hypertension have elevated plasma renin levels, while 85% of patients with essential hypertension have normal or decreased plasma renin levels. Reasons for this difference are not well understood. The primary structure of renin precursor consists of 406 amino acids with a pre- and a prosegment carrying 20 and 46 amino acids respectively. Mature renin contains 340 amino acids and has a mass of 37 kDa. Renin activates the renin—angiotensin system by cleaving angiotensinogen, produced in the liver, to yield angiotensin 1, which is further converted into angiotensin II by ACE, the angiotensin-converting enzyme. This is a membrane-bound enzyme present on the surface of the vascular endothelium of blood vessels throughout the body. The lung is the primary organ responsible for angiotensin II conversion, due to the large endothelial surface area of the many capillaries used in gas exchange. Angiotensin II then constricts blood vessels, increases the secretion of ADH and aldosterone and stimulates the hypothalamus to activate the thirst reflex, leading to increased blood pressure. \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G.

In adults, it is usually in the range of 150 ml. Not all the air we breathe in is able to be used for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. About a third of every resting breath is exhaled exactly as it came into the body. Because of dead space, taking deep breaths more slowly (eg ten 500-m1 breaths per minute) is more effective that taking shallow breaths quickly (eg, 20 250-ml breaths per minute). Although the amount of gas per minute is the same (5 l/min), a large proportion of the shallow breaths is dead space and does not allow oxygen to get into the blood. Dead space can be enlarged (and better envisaged) by breathing into a long tube. Even though one end of the tube is open to the air, when one inhales, it is mostly the carbon dioxide from expiration. Using a snorkel increases a diver\'s dead space in the airways (though usually not significantly). Dead space can be divided into two components: \'anatomical\' and \'physiological\'. \r\nAnatomical dead space is the gas in the conducting areas of the respiratory system, such as the mouth and trachea, where the air doesn\'t come to the alveoli of the lungs. it is normally about 150 ml (or 2.2 ml per kilogram of body weight). This is about a third of the resting tidal volume (450-500 ml). Anatomical dead space is the volume of the conducting airways. It may be measured by Fowler\'s method, a nitrogen wash-out technique. It increases with an increase in tidal volume and is dependent on posture. Physiological dead space is equal to the anatomical dead space plus the alveolar dead space. Alveolar dead space is the area in the alveoli that does receive air to be exchanged, but there is not enough blood flowing through the capillaries for exchange to be effective. It is normally very small (less than 5 ml) in healthy individuals. It can increase dramatically in some lung diseases. Physiological dead space can be measured by Bohr\'s method. \r\nThe product of tidal volume (volume moved in or out with each breath) times the frequency or breathing rate (number of breaths/min) is the total ventilation per minute (also called minute ventilation). In this clinical vignette, the total ventilation is 600 ml times 12 breaths/min = 7200 ml/min. As stated in the problem, the alveolar ventilation (air ventilating the respiratory zone for gas exchange each minute) is 6000 ml/min. The difference is that part of the total ventilation going only to non-exchanging conducting airways =1200 ml/min or 100 ml per breath.at 12 breaths/min. This 100 ml is the dead space volume. \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G. Raja', '2017-11-29 08:22:15', 'admin@bigm-bd.com', NULL, NULL, '1'),

Chronic obstructive lung diseases have little effect on pulmonary diffusion capacity. Breathing a hyperbaric gas mixture would increase the driving force and may overcome diffusion limitation in patients with mild fibrosis or interstitial oedema. Increasing the ventilatory rate will not have this effect and will only serve to maintain a high gradient of 02 from air to blood.

This gene encodes a cAMP-regulated Cl- channel. Since Cl- flux via this channel plays different roles in different epithelia, it is not surprising that the symptoms of cystic fibrosis are quite diverse. The volume-absorbing airway epithelium in cystic fibrosis patients shows increased Na+ reabsorption, probably because lack of CFTR increases the transepithelial potential difference. This results in thick dehydrated mucus predisposing to airway infections. This is in contrast to sweat glands, where cystic fibrosis patients secrete nearly normal volumes of sweat into the acinus, but are unable to absorb NaCI from sweat as it moves through the sweat duct. Therefore, the Na+ and Cl- content of sweat are both elevated in cystic fibrosis patients. Lack of CI- and water secretion in gastrointestinal epithelia can lead to severe constipation and obstruction of the small and large bowels. Impairment of the C1-/HCO3- exchange in pancreatic ductal epithelium results in water and enzyme retention and may eventually destroy the pancreas.

Inside the epithelial cells it promotes the formation of H2CO3..  Inhibition of this enzyme therefore increases bicarbonate concentration in the urine and results in a mild metabolic acidosis that counteracts the effect of respiratory alkalosis caused by hyperventilation in an oxygen-poor environment. Acetazolamide has been shown to relieve mild cases of altitude sickness in some people. However, it is not an immediate fix for altitude sickness; it speeds up acclimatisation, which in turn helps to relieve symptoms. This may take up to a day or two\'and requires waiting without any further rapid ascent. It is often advisable to descend if even mild altitude sickness is experienced. If serious sickness is encountered, descent is considered mandatory unless other circumstances present greater danger. Metabolic alkalosis would worsen the symptoms of mountain sickness.

Which of the following can produce the most potent effect in stimulating the respiratory centre and so increasing respiration?', 'D', '', 'Answer: D Decreases in the blood dioxide tension \r\nThe blood—brain barrier is almost totally impermeable to hydrogen ions, so that increases in the blood hydrogen ion concentration have relatively little effect on the hydrogen ion concentration in the vicinity of the respiratory centre. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, permeates the blood—brain barrier with ease and immediately reacts with water to form hydrogen ions. So, more hydrogen ions are released in the respiratory centre when the blood carbon dioxide concentration increases than when the blood hydrogen ion concentration increases. Unlike the effects of carbon dioxide and hydrogen ion concentration, oxygen lack does not directly stimulate the respiratory centre. Instead, it excites special nerve receptors called chemoreceptors located in minute carotid and aortic bodies that lie, respectively, in the carotid bifurcations and along the aorta. \r\nMechanical stimulation of the lungs can trigger certain reflexes, as discovered in animal studies. In humans, these seem to be more important in neonates and ventilated patients, but of little relevance in health. The tone of respiratory muscle is believed to be modulated by muscle spindles via a reflex arc involving the spinal cord. Drugs can greatly influence the control of respiration. Opioids and anaesthetic drugs tend to depress ventilation, especially with regards to carbon dioxide response. Stimulants such as amphetamines can cause hyperventilation. Pregnancy tends to increase ventilation (lowering plasma carbon dioxide tension below normal values). This is due to increased progesterone levels and results in enhanced gas exchange in the placenta.

The major cause of this increased renal excretion of K+ is:', 'A', '', 'Answer: A Increased secretion of K+ by the distal and collecting tubules \r\nThe majority of potassium (K+) in the body is stored intracellularly at about 40-50 mmol/kg. Only about 2% is distributed in the extracellular fluid compartment. The relative distribution of IK+ in the intracellular fluid vs extracellular fluid can be affected by insulin/glucose (which tends to move K+ into cells) or acid—base balance (acidosis tends to keep K+ out of cells). Usual dietary intake of K. varies from 80 to 150 mmol/day. Dietary intake of K\' in excess of daily requirements must be excreted in urine and stools (\'what goes in must come out\'). The renal handling of K+ is similar to sodium in many ways, except there is secretion in addition to filtration, reabsorption and excretion. In the glomerulus, K+ is freely filtered and, in the proximal tubule, it is reabsorbed like sodium and water (isotonic reabsorption due to facilitated transport with Na+, TF/UF = 1). In the loop of Henle, the thin descending limb is impermeable to K+, while the thin ascending limb is permeable to K*. In the thick ascending limb of loop of Henle, K+ reabsorption occurs secondary to Na+/K+/2C1- pump action. If Cl- reabsorption is blocked, K+ reabsorption will be blocked as well. Secretion of K+ occurs in the cortical collecting duct, whereas both secretion and reabsorption occur in the medullary collecting duct. K+ reabsorption is linked to Na\' reabsorption up to, but not including, the distal tubules. From the distal tubule and on, K+ is secreted and can be influenced by factors such as aldosterone. Very distally, K+ handling (secretion and reabsorption) becomes independent of Na+, enabling the body to make minor corrections to stay in Na+ and K+ balance. \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G.

(651, '1', 'Which of the following substances is actively secreted into the renal tubules?', 'D', '', 'Answer: D Potassium \r\nIn normal circumstances more than 90% of the filtered load of K is reabsorbed by the proximal tubules and loops of Henle and almost all K appearing in the urine has been secreted by the late distal tubules and collecting tubules. So the rate of excretion is usually independent of the rate of filtration, but is closely tied to the rate of secretion and control of K excretion is largely accomplished by control of the secretion rate. Around 65-70% of the filtered potassium is reabsorbed along with water in the proximal tubule and the concentration of potassium in the tubular fluid varies little from that of the plasma. The mechanisms involved are not completely understood. A large fraction of the reabsorption probably occurs by passive diffusion via the paracellular route. In addition a transport mechanism for K may exist in the apical membrane of tubular cells. In the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, potassium is transported out of the tubular fluid by the Na+—K+-2Cl- co-transporter. Some of this recycles back into the tubular fluid via K channels in the apical membrane but a fraction of it moves into the interstitial fluid. Approximately 20% of the filtered potassium is reabsorbed here. Note that transport out of the thick ascending limb establishes the potential for countercurrent trapping of potassium in the medulla in a manner similar to that for Na and NH. Potassium may be reabsorbed in the collecting tubule, perhaps by the H+/K+- ATPase mechanism. Both reabsorption and secretion can occur in this segment. Which process prevails depends upon the factors affecting each. Potassium is added to the tubular fluid by principal cells in the late distal tubule and in the cortical collecting tubule. K enters the secreting cells from the blood via the Na+/K+-ATPase pump. It then diffuses from the cell down the electrochemical gradient through K channels that exist in the lumina! or apical membrane into the tubular fluid. The electrical gradient across the apical membrane opposes the exit of K from the cell but that gradient is reduced by the Na flux through the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) in that membrane. So the chemical gradient dominates. A K—CI co-transporter (symport) may also exist in the apical membrane and transport both K and CI from the cell into the lumen. \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G.

This layer is so thin that molecules such as oxygen, water and lipids can pass through it by diffusion and enter the tissues. Waste products such as carbon dioxide and urea can diffuse back into the blood to be carried away for removal from the body. Capillary permeability can be increased by the release of certain cytokines.

Renal blood flow is closely related to renal plasma flow, which is the volume of blood plasma delivered to the kidney per unit time. Which of the following substances can be used to measure renal plasma flow rate?', 'D', '', 'Answer: D Para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) \r\nRenal blood flow (.RBF) is the volume of blood delivered to the kidney per unit time. In humans, the kidneys together receive roughly 20% of cardiac output, amounting to 11/min in a 70-kg adult man. RBF is closely related to RPF, which is the volume of blood plasma delivered to the kidney per unit time. While the terms generally apply to arterial blood delivered to the kidneys, both RBF and RPF can be used to quantify the volume of venous blood exiting the kidney per unit time. In this context, the terms are commonly given subscripts to refer to arterial or venous blood or plasma flow, as in RBF,, RBF, RPF, and RPF . Physiologically, however, the differences in these values are negligible so that arterial flow and venous flow are often assumed to be equal. Renal blood flow calculations are based on renal plasma flow and haematocrit (Hct). This follows from the fact that haematocrit estimates the fraction of blood consumed by red blood cells. Hence, the fraction of blood that is in the form of plasma is given by 1-Hct: \r\nRPF = RBF/(1-Hct). \r\nAlternatively: \r\nRBF = RPF \r\n1-Hct \r\nRenal plasma flow is given by the Fick principle: \r\nRPF = (Ux x V) + (Pa — Pv). \r\nThis is essentially a conservation of mass equation that balances the renal inputs (the renal artery) and the renal outputs (the renal vein and ureter). Put simply, a non-metabolisable solute entering the kidney via the renal artery has two points of exit, the renal vein and the ureter. The mass entering through the artery per unit time must equal the mass exiting through the vein and ureter per unit time: \r\nRPFax Pa = (RPFv x Pv) + (Ux x V) \r\nWhere P. is the arterial plasma concentration of the substance, Pv is its venous plasma concentration, Ux is its urine concentration and V is the urine flow rate. The product of flow and concentration gives mass per unit time. As mentioned previously, the difference between arterial and venous blood flow is negligible, so RPF, is assumed to be equal to RPFv so: \r\nRPFa x Pa = (RPFv x Pv) + (Ux x V). \r\nRearranging yields the previous equation for RPF: \r\nRPF = (Ua x + (Pa — Pv). \r\nValues of Pa are difficult to obtain in patients. In practice, PAH clearance is used instead to calculate the effective renal plasma flow (eRPF). PAH is freely filtered and it is net-secreted by the kidney, so that its venous plasma concentration is approximately zero. Setting P„ to zero in the equation for RPF yields: \r\neRPF = (UPAH x V) ÷Pa \r\nwhich is the equation for renal clearance. For PAH, this is commonly represented as: \r\neRPF = (UPAH ÷ PPAH)x V. \r\nSince the venous plasma concentration of PAH is not exactly zero (in fact, it is usually 10% of the PAH arterial plasma concentration), eRPF usually underestimates RPF by approximately 10%. This margin of error is acceptable considering the ease with which eRPF is measured. \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G. Raja', '2017-11-29 11:03:21', 'admin@bigm-bd.com', NULL, NULL, '1'),

In renal physiology, the concept of transport maximum is often discussed in the context of glucose and pars-arninohippuric acid (PAH). For both substances (as with all substances), the quantity excreted can be determined with the following equation: \r\nexcretion = (filtration + secretion) — reabsorption. \r\nThe body \'wants\' to retain glucose and eliminate PAH. However, its ability to do so is proportionate to the channel proteins available for the transmission: \r\n• Glucose is not secreted, so excretion = filtration — reabsorption. Both filtration and reabsorption are directly proportional to the concentration of glucose in the plasma. However, reabsorption has a transport maximum of about 300 mg/dl in healthy nephrons, while filtration has effectively no limit (within reasonable physiological ranges). So, if the concentration rises above 300 mg/di, the body cannot retain all the glucose, leading to glucosuria. \r\n• PAH is not reabsorbed, so excretion = filtration + secretion. As with glucose, the transfer is at the proximal tubule, but in the opposite direction: from the peritubular capillaries to the lumen. At low levels-, all the PAH is transferred, but at high levels, the transport maximum is reached and the PAH takes longer to clear. \r\nIn practice, the transport maximum is not all-or-nothing. As the concentration approaches the transport maximum, some of the channels are overwhelmed before others are. For example, with glucose, some sugar appears in the urine at levels much lower than 300 mg/dl. The point at which the effects start to appear is called \'threshold\', and the difference between threshold and transport maximum is called \'splay\'. \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G.

The finding of hypertension, hypokalaemia or both most commonly precipitates the decision to screen. The presence of these two features together has a 50% predictive value. \r\nThe first step entails confirmation that hyperaldosteronism is present and, if it is not present, exclusion of other conditions that produce a similar picture. The next step involves differentiating primary from secondary causes of hyperaldosteronism. The aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) is the most sensitive means of differentiating primary from secondary causes of hyperaldosteronism. It can be obtained under random conditions of sodium intake. Values obtained in the upright position (standing for 2 h) have greater sensitivity than supine test results. Patients should be normokalemic because hypokalaemia suppresses aldosterone secretion. A ratio of plasma aldosterone (ng/ dl) to plasma renin activity (ng/ml/h) of greater than 20 with a plasma aldosterone level greater than 15 ng/dI is highly suggestive of primary aldosteronism. The principle behind this test is that, as aldosterone secretion rises, plasma renin activity (PRA), a measure of the rate of production of angiotensin I from endogenous angiotensinogen, in ex vivo testing should fall because of sodium retention. This negative feedback response should occur when the aldosterone levels are supraphysiological for that individual patient and PRA may fall well before plasma aldosterone is clearly increased. When using this screening test, the aldosterone must be elevated in addition to an elevated ARR because, with the more sensitive PRA assays, having an ARR in excess of 20 without having an elevated aldosterone is possible. The most important factors that can interfere with the diagnostic reliability of the ARR test are drugs and renal impairment. Beta-blockers can reduce PRA levels, leading to a falsely elevated ratio and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (eg nifedipine) can reduce aldosterone levels, tending to lead to a falsely normal ratio in some patients with primary aldosteronism. Diuretics tend to induce secondary aldosteronism. Spironolactone, an aldosterone receptor antagonist, can raise plasma renin levels. Spironolactone and diuretics should be withheld for 6 weeks and 13-blockers and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists should be withheld for 5-7 days before testing. Patients\' hypertension can be controlled with diltiazem and a-blockers when testing for primary aldosteronism. Renal impairment can lead to a high aldosterone-to-renin ratio in patients without primary aldosteronism because fluid retention suppresses PRA and hyperkalaemia stimulates aldosterone secretion. After a positive screening test result, subsequent testing is directed at confirming aldosterone secretory autonomy and differentiating an aldosterone-producing adenoma, for which surgery is currently the first line of treatment, from idiopathic hyperaldosteronism, which is usually treated medically. The possibility of glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism, which accounts for approximately 1% of primary aldosteronism, should be kept in mind. \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G.

She is a candidate for haemodialysis as peritoneal dialysis in the presence of laparotomy will not be a suitable choice. Haemodialysis is a method for removing waste products such as potassium and urea, as well as free water from the blood when the kidneys are incapable of this (ie in renal failure). It is a form of renal replacement therapy. Haemodialysis is typically conducted in a dedicated facility, a special room in either a hospital or a clinic (with specialised nurses and technicians) that specialises in haemodialysis. Although less typical dialysis can also be done in a patient\'s home as home haemodialysis. The principle of haemodialysis is the same as other methods of dialysis: it involves diffusion of solutes across a semi-permeable membrane. Haemodialysis utilises countercurrent flow, where the dialysate is flowing in the opposite direction to blood flow in the extracorporeal circuit. Countercurrent flow maintains the concentration gradient across the membrane at a maximum and increases the efficiency of the dialysis. Fluid removal (ultrafiltration) is achieved by altering the hydrostatic pressure of the dialysate compartment, causing free water and some dissolved solutes to move across the membrane along a created pressure gradient. The dialysis solution that is used is a sterilised solution of mineral ions. Urea and other waste products, and also potassium and phosphate, diffuse into the dialysis solution. However, concentrations of sodium and chloride are similar to those of normal plasma to prevent loss. Bicarbonate is added in a higher concentration than plasma to correct blood acidity. A small amount of glucose commonly is also used. Note that this process is different from the related technique of haemofiltration. \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G.

(700, '1', 'A 16-year-old girl with gross facial and ankle oedema was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome. In this patient oedema is most probably due to:', 'B', '', 'Answer: B Decreased oncotic pressure\r\n The glomeruli of the kidneys are the parts that normally filter the blood. They consist of capillaries that are fenestrated (leaky, due to little holes called fenestrae or windows) and that allow fluid, salts and other small solutes to flow through, but normally not proteins. In nephrotic syndrome, the glomeruli become damaged due to diabetes, glomerulonephritis or even prolonged hypertension so that small proteins, such as albumin can pass through the kidneys into urine. Nephrotic syndrome is characterised by proteinuria (detectable protein in the urine) and low albumin levels in blood plasma. As a compensation, the liver begins to make more of all its proteins and levels of large proteins (such as aimacroglobulin) increase. Oedema usually occurs due to salt and water retention by the diseased kidneys as well as sometimes due to the reduced colloid oncotic pressure (because of reduced albumin in the plasma). Cholesterol levels are also increased and though, the mechanism is not fully understood, it is thought to be due to the increased synthesis of lipoproteins in the liver. There is an increased tendency for thrombosis (up to 25%), perhaps due to urinary loss of inhibitors of clotting such as antithrombin III, as well as hypovolaemia due to movement of water from plasma into tissue (causing oedema). Similar loss of immunoglobulins increases the risks of infections and relevant immunisation is recommended against pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae and meningococci. \r\n\r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G.

Its cause remains unclear, although the principal cause appears to be a substance or substances from the placenta causing endothelial dysfunction in the maternal blood vessels. While blood pressure elevation is the most visible sign of the disease, it involves generalised damage to the maternal endothelium and kidneys and liver, with the release of vasopressive factors only secondary to the original damage. Pre-eclampsia may develop at varying times within pregnancy and its progress differs among patients; most cases present pre-term.

Which of the following indices would be expected to be decreased in the donor after full recovery from the operation?', 'A', '', 'Answer: A Creatinine clearance \r\nLive donation is split into four groups. Within the living-related (LR) group there are three types. The HLA-identical group comprises usually brothers and sisters with the same genetic make-up. The 1-haplotype mismatches group accounts for the greatest percentage of live donor transplants and includes brother, sister and mother. The 2-haplotype mismatch group also includes sister, brother and grandmother. Lastly there is the living-unrelated (LUR) group. The survival rates are definitely better than those of cadaver transplants. There are, however, differences within each of the live donor groups. It is estimated that the half-life of an HLA-identical kidney is between 24 and 26 years and as most patients in this group are around 35 years of age, most will only ever require one transplant in their lifetime. In the 1-haplotype group, half-life is approximately 11-12 years. Patients in this group tend to be slightly older (around 45 years) and it is estimated that approximately 50% of patients have a treatment for life. The half-life of the 2-haplotype and LUR kidney is similar to that of the cadaveric kidney, around 9-10 years, but it is reported that the live-donor group experience fewer rejection episodes, need less immunosuppression and have reduced complications from immunosuppression as a result. \r\nAdditionally, graft function following live donation is usually much quicker (normally immediate) compared with cadaver kidneys and fewer problems are experienced with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). This is believed to be associated with shorter delays in transplanting the organ. This is called the cold ischaemic time, in which the kidney, after removal, is perfused to enhance preservation. In live kidney transplantation the organ is transplanted almost immediately, limiting the ischaemic time of the kidney, whereas the cadaveric kidney may have a 12-48-hour delay before being transplanted, so lengthening the ischaemic time and resulting in delayed function of the kidney. \r\nMost problems encountered with live donation are associated with the donor. Firstly, there are the potentially harmful investigative procedures carried out in the assessment phase, the most hazardous being renal angiOgraphy, where there is cannulation of the artery and injection of a radio-opaque dye to determine the blood supply to the kidney. Secondly, there are the short-term risks of nephrectomy \'surgery. According to the literature, there is a mortality rate of between 1 in 1600 and 1 in 3000, but this no more than is associated with any anaesthetic. Other associated risks come with most major abdominal surgery and include haemorrhage, chest and wound infection, pneumothorax, prolonged ileus, thrombosis and, most \r\n\r\nimportantly, pulmonary embolism, which is the most common cause of death following nephrectomy. In the initial postoperative period creatinine clearance may be decreased but this recovers fully over a few weeks to months. \r\nLong-term complications include prolonged wound pain. Initially this is alleviated with the help of opiate analgesia. Hypertension is often noted in the literature as a long-term complication of kidney donation and carries a risk of about 30%, but it is also noted that this is no more than in other people of the same age group. Patients are also told of the possibility of developing proteinuria, which is an early sign of kidney disease; however, many studies have failed to show any significant increase associated with renal impairment. It is therefore necessary for long-term follow-up of these patients to minimise the potential morbidity from associated problems of kidney donation. In clinical terms, live kidney donation is considered to carry a minimal risk and with the benefits for the recipient would seem a potentially valuable source for organ retrieval. \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G.

Like lactase and maltase, these peptidases are integral membrane proteins rather than soluble enzymes. They function to further the hydrolysis of lumina! peptides, converting them to free amino acids and very small peptides. These end- products of digestion, formed on the surface of the enterocyte, are ready for absorption. The mechanism by which amino acids are absorbed is conceptually identical to that of monosaccharides. The lumina! plasma membrane of the absorptive cell bears at least four sodium-dependent amino acid co-transporters — one each for acidic, basic, neutral and amino acids. These transporters bind amino acids only after binding sodium. The fully loaded transporter then undergoes a conformational change that dumps sodium and the amino acid into the cytoplasm, followed by its reorientation back to the original form. So, absorption of amino acids is also absolutely dependent on the electrochemical gradient of sodium across the epithelium. Further, absorption of amino acids, like that of monosaccharides, contributes to generating the osmotic gradient that drives water absorption. The basolateral membrane of the enterocyte contains additional transporters, which export amino acids from the cell into blood.

There is little to no structural damage. The most common cause of this type of diarrhoea is a cholera toxin that stimulates the secretion of anions, especially chloride ions. Therefore, to maintain a charge balance in the lumen, sodium is carried with it along with water. \r\n•	Osmotic diarrhoea occurs when there is a loss of water due to a heavy osmotic load. This can occur when there is maldigestion (eg pancreatic disease or coeliac disease), where the nutrients are left in the lumen, which pulls water into the lumen. \r\n•	Motility-related diarrhoea occurs when the motility of the gastrointestinal tract is abnormal. If the food moves too quickly, there is not enough contact time between the food and the membrane, meaning that there is not enough time for the nutrients and water to be absorbed. This can follow a vagotomy or diabetic neuropathy. \r\n•	Inflammatory diarrhoea occurs when there is damage to the mucosal lining or brush border, which leads to a passive loss of protein-rich fluids and a decreased ability to absorb these lost fluids. Features of all three of the other types of diarrhoea can be found in this type of diarrhoea. It can be caused by bacterial infections, viral infections, parasitic infections or autoimmune problems such as inflammatory bowel disease. \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G.

It is about 2-4 m long in humans, follows the duodenum and jejunum and is separated from the caecum by the ileocaecal valve. The pH in the ileum is usually between 7 and 8 (neutral or slightly alkaline). The chief function of the ileum is to absorb the products of digestion. The wall itself is made up of folds, each of which has many tiny finger-like projections, known as villi, on its surface. In turn, the epithelial cells that line these villi possess even larger numbers of microvilli. Therefore, the ileum has an extremely large surface area both for the adsorption (attachment) of enzyme molecules and for the absorption of products of digestion. The cells that line the ileum contain the protease and carbohydrate enzymes responsible for the final stages of protein and carbohydrate digestion. These enzymes are present in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells. The villi contain large numbers of capillaries, which take the amino acids and glucose produced by digestion to the hepatic portal vein and the liVer. Lacteals are small lymph vessels and are present in villi. They absorb fatty acid and glycerol, the products of fat digestion. Ileal resection will result in increased fat content of the stool. Another important function of ileum, which will be lost after ileal resection, is absorption of vitamin B12. The jejunum absorbs more water than the ileum, but the colon is the most efficient water-absorbing segment of the gut. Therefore, extracellular fluid volume deficiency is least likely to be seen after ileal resection.

These cobalamins are bound to R proteins, ie, haptocorrin (HC) secreted from salivary glands and gastric juice. Intrinsic factor (IF) is a cobalamin-binding protein secreted by the gastric parietal cells. Its secretory rate usually parallels that of HCI. Dietary cobalamin bound to food proteins is released in the stomach by pepsin and acid pH and more free cobalamin binds to HC than IF. The cobalamin—HC complex moves to the intestinal lumen, is digested by pancreatic proteases and the liberated cobalamin now complexes with IF. The cobalamin—IF complex moves through the small intestine and binds to a transmembrane receptor (IFCR) in the ileum.

(736, '1', 'Iron-deficiency anaemia is often seen in patients following gastrectomy. The reason for this anaemia is:', 'A', '', 'Answer: A Acid secreted by stomach enhances iron absorption \r\nDietary iron contains both inorganic iron and haem. Both forms are actively absorbed by the duodenum. Iron is released from haem inside the mucosal cell and transferred into the body as inorganic iron. Fe\'• is absorbed faster than Fe3* because ferric iron is insoluble above pH 3, whereas ferrous iron remains soluble at pH 8. Dietary constituents such as phosphates, carbonates and oxalates reduce iron absorption because they form insoluble complexes with iron. These iron complexes are more soluble at low pH. Therefore, HCI secreted by the stomach enhances iron absorption and that is why patients with gastrectomy of ten have iron-deficiency anaemia. Ascorbate also promotes iron absorption. The quantity of iron in the body is maintained by controlled absorption from the duodenum. Iron deficiency enhances erythropoiesis and hypoxia increases intestinal iron absorption. Iron is stored in the mucosal cell as a ferritin complex. When iron absorption is increased, no ferritin complex is formed and the iron is rapidly delivered into the plasma. When iron absorption is depressed, more iron is trapped in the form of a ferritin complex and retained in the mucosal cell. When Fee* leaves the mucosal cell, transferrin in the circulating blood is the carrier that delivers it to other tissues via transferrin receptors in the plasma membrane. . \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G.

The primary area involved in this disease is:', 'E', '', 'Answer: E Substantia nigra \r\nParkinson\'s disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that often impairs the sufferer\'s motor skills and speech. Parkinson\'s disease belongs to a group of conditions called movement disorders. It is characterised by muscle rigidity, tremor, a slowing of physical movement (bradykinesia) and, in extreme cases, a loss of physical movement (akinesia). The primary symptoms are the results of excessive muscle contraction, normally caused by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine, which is produced in the dopaminergic neurones of the brain. Secondary symptoms may include high-level cognitive dysfunction and subtle language problems. Parkinson\'s disease is both chronic and progressive. Parkinson\'s disease is the most common cause of Parkinsonism, a group of similar symptoms. Parkinson\'s disease is also called \'primary Parkinsonism\' or \'idiopathic Parkinson\'s disease (\'idiopathic\' meaning of no known cause). While most forms of Parkinsonism are idiopathic, there are some cases where the symptoms may result from toxicity, drugs, genetic mutation, head trauma or other medical disorders. The symptoms of Parkinson\'s disease result from the loss of pigmented dopamine-secreting (dopaminergic) cells and subsequent loss of melanin, secreted by the same cells, in the pars compacta region of the substantia nigra (literally \'black substance\'). These neurones project to the striatum and their loss leads to alterations in the activity of the neural circuits within the basal ganglia that regulate movement, in essence an inhibition of the direct pathway and excitation of the indirect pathway. \r\nThe direct pathway facilitates movement and the indirect pathway inhibits movement, so the loss of these cells leads to a hypokinetic movement disorder. The lack of dopamine results in increased inhibition of the ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus, which sends excitatory projections to the motor cortex, so leading to hypokinesia. There are four major dopamine pathways in the brain: the nigrostriatal pathway, referred to above, mediates movement and is the most conspicuously affected in early Parkinson\'s disease. The other pathways are the mesiocortical, the mesiolimbic and the tuberoinfundibular.These pathways are associated with, respectively: volition and emotional responsiveness; desire, initiative and reward; sensory processes and maternal behaviour. Disruption of dopamine along the non-striatal pathways probably explains much of the neuropsychiatric pathology associated with Parkinson\'s disease. \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G.

(766, '1', 'A lesion of the posterior column—medial lemniscus system is most likely to affect:', 'A', '', 'Answer: A Fine touch \r\nThe posterior column—medial lemniscus pathway is the sensory pathway responsible for transmitting fine touch and conscious proprioceptive information from the body to the cerebral cortex. The name comes from the two structures that the sensation travels up: the posterior (or dorsal) columns of the spinal cord and the medial lemniscus in the brainstem. Because the posterior columns are also called dorsal columns, the pathway is often called the dorsal column—medial lemniscus system or DCML for short. (Also called posterior column—medial lernniscus or PCML pathway). Discriminative sensation is well developed in the fingers of humans and allows us to feel fine textures and determine what an unknown object in our hands is without looking at it. This fine sensation is detected by Meissner\'s corpuscles that lie in the dermis of the skin close to the epidermis. When these structures are stimulated by slight pressure, an action potential is started. The action potential travels up an axon (the cell body of the neurone will be in a dorsal root ganglion). (The neurones are classified as unipolar, so they are regarded as having just one long process, an axon.) Therefore, the sensation travels from the skin, along the axon, past the neuronal cell body and into the dorsal column of the spinal cord. The axons continue inside the spinal cord, running up the posterior (dorsal) column. Axons from the lower body are most medial (closer to the midline) and run in the gracile tract of the spinal column. Sensory axons from the upper body enter the spinal cord later, so are more lateral and travel up the cuneate tract. \r\nAt the level of the closed medulla oblongata, these axons synapse with neurones in the gracile and cuneate nuclei. The secondary neurones (that start in the nuclei) cross over to the other side of the medulla (as internal arcuate fibres) to form the medial lemniscus. At the medulla, the medial lemniscus is orientated perpendicular to the way the fibres travelled in the posterior columns. For example, in the columns, lower limb is medial, upper limb is more lateral. At the medial lemniscus, axons from the leg are more ventral, arm fibres more dorsal. Fibres from the trigeminal nerve (supplying the head) come in dorsal to the arm fibres and travel up the lemniscus too. The medial lemniscus rotates 90 degrees at the pons. The secondary axons from neurones giving sensation to the head stay at around the same place, while the leg axons move outwards. The axons travel up the rest of the brainstem and synapse at the thalamus (at the ventral posterolateral nucleus). Neurones starting in the thalamus travel up the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and again, head and leg swap relative positions. The axons synapse in the primary sensory cortex, with lower body sensation most medial (eg, the paracentral lobule) and upper body more lateral\r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G.

However, if the patient has had recent head trauma, is immunocompromised, has known malignancy or central nervous system neoplasm or focal neurological deficits such as papilloedema or altered consciousness, computed tomography (CT) or MRI should be performed before the LP to avoid a potentially fatal brain herniation during the procedure.

It is frequently severe and usually exhibits as an ascending paralysis noted by weakness in the legs that spreads to the upper limbs and the face along with complete loss of deep tendon reflexes. About 75% of patients with GBS have a history of acute infection within the past 1-4 weeks, usually respiratory or gastrointestinal. 20— 30% of these cases are due to Campylobacter jejuni and a similar proportion due to cytomegalovirus or Epstein—Barr virus. The risk of developing Guillain—Barre syndrome following campylobacter infection is less than two per 10 000 in the following 2 months. Less common infectious agents include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, HIV and herpes simplex virus. Immunisations have also been implicated in GBS.

These corpuscles are found in mesenteries, especially the pancreas, and are often found near joints. Like Ruffini endings, they are found in deep subcutaneous tissue and are considered rapidly adapting receptors. Similar in physiology to the Meissner\'s corpuscle, Pacinian corpuscles are larger and fewer in number than both Merkel cells and Meissner\'s corpuscles. The Pacinian corpuscle is ovoid and approximately 1 mm in length. The entire corpuscle is wrapped by a layer of connective tissue. It has 20-60 concentric lamellae composed of fibrous connective tissue and fibroblasts, separated by gelatinous material. The lamellae are very thin, flat, modified Schwann cells. In the centre of the corpuscle is the inner bulb, a fluid-filled cavity with a single afferent unmyelinated nerve ending. Pacinian corpuscles detect gross pressure changes and vibrations. Any deformation in the corpuscle causes action potentials to be generated, by opening pressure-sensitive sodium ion channels in the axon membrane. This allows sodium ions to influx, creating a receptor potential (independent of potassium channels). These corpuscles are especially susceptible to vibrations, which they can sense even centimetres away. Pacinian corpuscles cause action potentials when the skin is rapidly indented but not when the pressure is steady, due to the layers of connective tissue that cover the nerve ending. It is thought that they respond to high velocity changes in joint position. Pacinian corpuscles have a large receptive field on the skin\'s surface, with an especially sensitive centre.

It is a monosynaptic reflex that provides automatic regulation of skeletal muscle length. Muscle spindles Are sensory apparatus sensitive to stretch of the muscle in which they lie. Suppose a person standing in the upright position begins to lean to one side. \r\nThe postural muscles that are closely connected to the vertebral column on the side will stretch. Because of this, stretch receptors in those muscles contract to correct posture. The patellar (knee jerk) reflex is an example. Another example is the group la fibres in the calf muscle, which synapse with motor neurones supplying muscle fibres in the same muscle. A sudden stretch, such as tapping the Achilles\' tendon, causes a reflex contraction in the muscle as the spindles sense the stretch and send an action potential to the motor neurones, which then cause the muscle to contract; this particular reflex causes a contraction in the soleus—gastrocnemius group of muscles. This reflex can be enhanced by the Jendrassik manoeuvre. In upper motor neurone lesion the stretch reflexes are brisk, due to loss of inhibitory signals on gamma neurones through the lateral reticulospinal tract. \r\n', NULL, 'Physiology , Shazad G.

The activity of this system is crucial for maintaining the state of consciousness. It is situated at the core of the brainstem between the myelencephalon (medulla oblongata) and mesencephalon (midbrain). It is involved with the circadian rhythm; damage can lead to permanent coma. It is thought to be the area affected by many psychotropic drugs. General anaesthetics work through their effect on the reticular formation. Fibres from the reticular formation are also vital in controlling respiration, cardiac rhythms and other essential functions. The reticular activating system has received attention from neuroscientists interested in various pathological conditions affecting behaviour, such as Alzheimer\'s disease. More recently, results of research on the area has prompted extrapolations from the data into various areas such as motivational programmes and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The reticular activating system is believed to cause ADHD due to an unbalance of noradrenaline in the cells. This leads to the over-arousal and lack of motivation associated with these disorders. Although the functioning of this system is a prerequisite for consciousness to occur, it is generally assumed that this system\'s role is indirect and it does not by itself, generate consciousness.
